  <h1><center><u>The Quiz</u></center></h1>
  <div class="container">
  <div class="row">
  <h3><b>Why did we decide on a Quiz?</b></h3>
  <p>The reason we wanted to make a quiz to display and answer indiviuals hair types is as most indiviuals dont know what type of hair they are!
  <br><br>
  This can be from males, females and everything inbetween as both questions can aim at all genders without trouble,
  because of this we wanted to make a service that would help indiviuals who didnt know this information to inform them of what they should get to know, this can help with developing healthy hair.
  <br><br>
  This service is free to the public as you are currently using the service for yourself, by using the quiz you will be given four (4) major hair types with four (4) minor categories within those major types.
  These types have a major impact on how you should treat your hair, But what if you use a product not compatable with your hair? well it's no issue we just give recommendations we arent qualified hair professionals
  we are far from it, we are programming and IT student who have an intrest in helping indiviuals.
  <br><br>
  Both major hair types from Straight - Wavy - Curly - Coily, have diffrent aspects to making them unique especially between genders, as the appearance changes but slighly because of this they are split into different
  categories, for the quiz we just include all without any boders between gender but we specify when you have your major hair type then it will display the minor categories fro your information and insight to learn more.

  <h3><b>Who are We?</b></h3>
  <p>The people behind Hair4U are just four (4) college student who have a passionate intrest in programming and web development, we came up with the idea when brainstorming what we would like to do for our major team project module project
  after the session we decided on a hair product and help quiz.
  <br><br>
  We are all third (3rd) year student in a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in coding and business systems, this is a four (4) year course for us all which we have been working hard during this trying time.We hava great experience in making websites
  but this is the first time creating a quiz with multiple questions that lead onto other question for diffrent integrated answers, this was a challenge for us studens as it was a challenging yet rewarding experience to overcome within a group 
  of colleagues that havent worked together before.
